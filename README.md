# Overview
You will be showing us how you deal with completing a project to design specifications in a short amount of time. This is as much about showing us how well you can learn as it is getting the correct output, so even if things aren’t perfect at the end of your time, we still want to see where you got to.
The design specs (in photoshop and jpeg format) are **found in this same folder. Please try to make this look as much like the design as you possibly can.**

# Blizzard API Take-Home Test
You will be building a small web application that allows users to search for their World of Warcraft character, have that information be retrieved, and display it on the screen. 
Blizzard has an API for a lot of their games which allows devs to grab certain information about their online games like **World Of Warcraft**: https://develop.battle.net/ 
You need to register in order to get an API key, but it only takes like 5 minutes and it’s completely free.  
There is a lot of documentation on how to use it: https://develop.battle.net/documentation/guides/getting-started

**Here is your assignment**:

Use the Blizzard API to allow a user to search for characters by **character name** and **realm**. There are a lot of fields that can be returned, but here’s what we want:

		●	Character Stats: at a minimum,

			o	Level of the character
			o	Health
			o	Strength
			o	Agility
			o	Intelligence
			o	Stamina 
			o	Haste

	●	Items: All equipped items (everything in the Items API call). **Bonus** if you also get information about the 
	**buy price, sell price, and/or required level** of the items equipped.

Requirements: 

	●	Turn in a web site that someone can look at and use - either just the files, or a link to the hosted project.

	●	Make it look as close as possible to the attached design. Note: Not everything in the assignment is in the design. 
	Use your best judgement on how to build out the items section and build it as close to the design as possible.

	●	Make sure to handle any possible errors that could occur as a result of using the webpage. 

	●	Input areas for:

			o	Character Name
			o	Realm Name (could also be a drop-down)

	●	If you have extra time, impress us! Add extra functionality.

For a test character, you can search **Regex** on the realm **Dalaran**.
